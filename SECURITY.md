# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report security issues via **GitHub Security Advisories** for this repository (preferred).  
If you cannot use advisories, open a minimal issue **without sensitive details** and we will coordinate a secure channel.

## Supported Versions
MLSDM currently supports the **main branch** and tagged releases (when present).  
Security fixes are applied to the latest supported release line and/or main.

## Coordinated Disclosure
We follow coordinated disclosure. Please allow reasonable time to triage and patch before public disclosure.
