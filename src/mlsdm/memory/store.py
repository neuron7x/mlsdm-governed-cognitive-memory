"""MemoryStore Protocol and Data Structures for Persistent LTM.

This module provides the stable interface for long-term memory (LTM) storage
backends. It defines protocols, dataclasses, and utilities for storing and
retrieving memory items with metadata including provenance, TTL, and PII flags.

The design follows these principles:
- Protocol-based for flexibility (multiple backends possible)
- Type-safe with full type hints
- Separation of concerns (storage abstraction)
- AI Safety: built-in PII scrubbing and provenance tracking
