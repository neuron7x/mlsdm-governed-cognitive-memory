"""
Bulkhead pattern implementation for fault isolation.

This module provides bulkhead (compartmentalization) functionality to prevent
cascading failures by limiting concurrent operations per compartment. Each
compartment has its own semaphore-based concurrency limit.

Usage:
    bulkhead = Bulkhead()
    with bulkhead.acquire(BulkheadCompartment.LLM_GENERATION):
        # perform operation
        result = some_llm_call()

The bulkhead pattern ensures that failures or overload in one subsystem
(e.g., LLM generation) don't cascade to other subsystems (e.g., memory
retrieval, embedding).
