"""
Environment Variable Compatibility Layer.

Provides backward compatibility for legacy environment variables.

Note: This module is currently a placeholder for future compatibility needs.
Most environment variables (CONFIG_PATH, LLM_BACKEND, DISABLE_RATE_LIMIT) are
already part of the stable API and handled directly by RuntimeConfig in runtime.py.

DISABLE_RATE_LIMIT is handled natively by RuntimeConfig and does not need mapping
to MLSDM_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED because:
1. MLSDM_* prefix is reserved for SystemConfig env overrides (cognitive engine config)
2. DISABLE_RATE_LIMIT is part of RuntimeConfig (deployment/server config)
3. RuntimeConfig handles the inversion logic directly (see runtime.py line 305-311)

This separation maintains clear boundaries between:
- SystemConfig: Cognitive engine configuration (embeddings, memory, etc.)
- RuntimeConfig: Runtime/deployment configuration (server, security, observability)
