# Comprehensive Audit Register (Strategic-Execution Order)

**Document Version:** 1.0.0  
**Project Version:** 1.2.0  
**Last Updated:** December 2025  
**Status:** Active – compiled in response to the strategic execution order for a full-code and test audit.

---

## Scope & Method

This register consolidates code, test, CI/CD, security, documentation, and dependency findings into a single ledger with severity bands (Critical/High/Medium/Low). Evidence sources include:

- ✅ Latest green CI on `main`: run `ci-neuro-cognitive-engine` #1790 (2025-12-20) – full test/type/lint matrix.  
- ⚠️ PR run #1791 required manual approval (`action_required`) – no jobs executed (workflows gated).  
- 📄 Prior structured reviews: `ENGINEERING_DEFICIENCIES_REGISTER.md`, `TECHNICAL_DEBT_REGISTER.md`, `RISK_REGISTER.md`.  
- 🧪 Local defaults: `make test` (unit/integration minus load), `coverage_gate.sh` (75% line threshold), `ruff`, `mypy`, `deptry`, `pip-audit`.

Quality gates recommended for every merge:

1) `ruff check src tests`  
2) `mypy src/mlsdm`  
3) `pytest --ignore=tests/load` + `coverage_gate.sh` (fail_under=75)  
4) `pip-audit` and `deptry`  
5) CI `dependency-review`, `sast-scan`, property tests matrix  
6) Scheduled/nightly load/perf suite (`tests/load`, `benchmarks/`)

## Audit Registry

| ID | Category | Severity | Status | Location | Symptom | Root Cause | Impact/Risk | Repro/Detection | Recommended Fix | Closure Criteria | Evidence |
|----|----------|----------|--------|----------|---------|------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|----------|
| AUD-SEC-001 | Security / Code | High | Open | `src/mlsdm/security/llm_safety.py` | Policy drift and multi-turn jailbreak detection lacks automated alerting | Drift detection (R012) still not implemented end-to-end | Safety controls can silently degrade, allowing harmful output | Lower moral threshold in config and run conversation – no drift alert emitted | Add drift monitor with metrics/alerts; tie into moral filter EMA; add unit/integration tests | Alert emitted + test coverage for drift scenarios; CI gate executing new tests | `RISK_REGISTER.md` (R012), `ENGINEERING_DEFICIENCIES_REGISTER.md` SEC-S001 |
| AUD-CODE-001 | Code / CI | Medium | Open | `src/mlsdm/api/*`, `.github/workflows/ci-neuro-cognitive-engine.yml` | Breaking API changes are not caught in CI | No OpenAPI diff/version guard in pipeline | Clients can break without detection | Change response schema → CI still passes | Add OpenAPI diff step + versioned routes; publish schema artifact | CI fails on incompatible API diff; schema artifact stored per release | `ENGINEERING_DEFICIENCIES_REGISTER.md` ARCH-S001 |
| AUD-CODE-002 | Code / Security | Medium | Open | `src/mlsdm/memory/*` | Memories lack provenance metadata/guardrails | Provenance tracking for hallucination mitigation (R015) not implemented | Untrusted memory can propagate without attribution | Insert synthetic memory entry → no source/policy trace recorded | Attach source/timestamp/policy decision to memory entries; add rejection guard tests | Provenance fields enforced in models; tests asserting rejection of untrusted entries | `ENGINEERING_DEFICIENCIES_REGISTER.md` SEC-S001 (R015) |
| AUD-TEST-001 | Tests | Medium | Open | `Makefile` (`pytest --ignore=tests/load`) | Load/stress suite excluded from default test target | Default `make test` omits `tests/load` to save time | Perf/resource regressions may ship unnoticed | Run `make test` → load tests not executed | Add nightly CI job for `tests/load` + document pre-release requirement | Nightly job green or fails on regression; release checklist references it | `Makefile` line 51; `TESTING_STRATEGY.md` (load tests optional) |
| AUD-CI-001 | CI/CD | Low | Open | `.github/workflows/ci-neuro-cognitive-engine.yml` | PR run #1791 ended `action_required` with zero jobs | Workflow requires maintainer approval for PR, leaving gaps until approved | PRs can appear green in UI while checks not executed | Observe run_id 20390587472 → no jobs | Enforce branch protection requiring successful workflow; auto-request approval/rerun | run_id transitions to `success` after approval; branch protection blocks merge otherwise | GitHub Actions run #20390587472 |
| AUD-DEP-001 | Dependencies | Medium | Open | `requirements*.txt`, `uv.lock` | Outstanding pip-audit finding (1 vulnerability) noted in last sweep | Vulnerable transitive dependency not yet bumped | Security exposure until patched | Run `pip-audit` → 1 vuln reported | Re-run `pip-audit`, patch package, pin in `uv.lock`; add CI step | `pip-audit` returns 0 vulns in CI | `TECHNICAL_DEBT_REGISTER.md` (pip-audit row, 2025-12-19) |
| AUD-DOC-001 | Documentation | Low | Resolved (this doc) | Documentation set | No single audit ledger spanning code/tests/CI/security/deps | Audit info fragmented across multiple registers | Hard to verify readiness quickly | N/A (process gap) | Maintain this consolidated register and link from doc index | Register published and discoverable via `DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` | Current document |

## Remediation Plan (Prioritized)

1. **Blockers (High):** Implement policy drift monitor (AUD-SEC-001).  
2. **Stability:** Add OpenAPI diff gate + memory provenance (AUD-CODE-001/002).  
3. **Risk Containment:** Enable scheduled load tests and enforce CI approval+branch protection (AUD-TEST-001, AUD-CI-001).  
4. **Security Hygiene:** Patch pip-audit finding and keep dependency review green (AUD-DEP-001).  
5. **Governance:** Keep this register updated per release (AUD-DOC-001).
