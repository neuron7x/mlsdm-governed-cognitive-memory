# Version: 1.1.0
# Last Updated: December 2025
# Status: ACTIVE

policy_contract_version: "1.1"
version: "1.1"
policy_name: "MLSDM Security Baseline"
enforcement_level: "blocking"  # CI must fail if any check fails

  email: "security@mlsdm.dev"
rationale: >-
  Establishes non-negotiable security controls and CI gating to prevent
  regressions, enforce vulnerability response timelines, and guarantee
  auditable governance across the MLSDM delivery pipeline.
