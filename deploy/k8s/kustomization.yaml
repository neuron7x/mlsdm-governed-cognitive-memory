# Kustomization for MLSDM Production Deployment
# ====================================================
# Provides a unified way to deploy all MLSDM Kubernetes resources.
#
# Usage:
#   # Preview what will be deployed
#   kubectl kustomize deploy/k8s/
#
#   # Apply all resources
#   kubectl apply -k deploy/k8s/
#
#   # Delete all resources
#   kubectl delete -k deploy/k8s/
#
# For environment-specific overlays, create:
#   deploy/k8s/overlays/staging/
#   deploy/k8s/overlays/production/
