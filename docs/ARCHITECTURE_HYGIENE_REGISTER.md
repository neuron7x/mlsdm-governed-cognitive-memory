## Purpose

This register tracks architectural hygiene gaps, their impact, and ownership. It provides a single place to record issues that affect architectural consistency, dependency boundaries, or policy alignment.

## Governance

- **Who can add records:** Staff/Principal Engineers, Architecture Owners, or delegated Tech Leads for a domain.
- **Required reviewers:** Architecture Owner for the affected domain plus one platform maintainer.
- **Review cadence:** Quarterly review (first week of each quarter) and mandatory review before major releases.
- **How to add:** Submit a PR updating the table below with evidence, impact, and an owner. Mark status as Open/Investigating/Resolved.
