# Repository Architecture Map

## Top-level structure

- `src/`: Core runtime, model orchestration, and system logic for the neuro-inspired AI engine.
- `docs/`: Specifications, protocols, runbooks, and system documentation.
- `tests/`: Unit, integration, and system tests aligned with validation strategies.
- `scripts/`: Developer and CI utilities for automation, analysis, and maintenance.
- `config/`: Configuration schemas, defaults, and environment-specific settings.
- `deploy/`: Deployment manifests, infrastructure scaffolding, and release assets.
- `policies/`: Governance, safety, and compliance policy artifacts (`yaml/` for policy sources, `opa/` for OPA rules).
- `reports/`: Generated evaluation, audit, and CI evidence reports.
