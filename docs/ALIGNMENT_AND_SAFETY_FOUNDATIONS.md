## 1. Overview

MLSDM addresses AI safety through a multi-layered approach that combines:
1. **Architectural constraints** (bounded memory, formal invariants)
2. **Behavioral governance** (moral filtering, language quality control)
3. **Observability and testing** (property-based verification, chaos engineering)
4. **Standards compliance** (IEEE, NIST alignment)

This document establishes the AI safety and alignment foundations for each component.

## 2. Current Risks in LLM Systems

### 2.1 Hallucinations and Factual Errors

**Problem:**
LLMs generate plausible but factually incorrect or nonsensical outputs [Ji et al., 2023]:
- Fabricated citations and sources
- Logically inconsistent statements
- Confident assertions about unknown topics
- Context-dependent confabulation

**Consequences:**
- Misinformation propagation
- User trust erosion
- Safety-critical failures in high-stakes domains
- Legal and reputational risks

**MLSDM Mitigation:**
- **Memory provenance**: All retrieved information tagged with source and timestamp
- **Confidence scoring**: Uncertainty markers in low-confidence regions
- **Aphasia detection**: Flags degraded outputs that may indicate hallucination
- **Observability**: Complete audit trail for post-hoc verification

### 2.2 Toxicity and Harmful Content

**Problem:**
LLMs can generate toxic, offensive, or harmful content [Ji et al., 2023]:
- Hate speech and discriminatory language
- Instructions for illegal activities
- Self-harm or violence promotion
- Sexually explicit or abusive content

**Training Data Issues:**
- Internet-scale pretraining includes toxic content
- Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is imperfect
- Adversarial users actively probe for vulnerabilities

**MLSDM Mitigation:**
- **MoralFilterV2**: Adaptive moral scoring with bounded drift
- **Rejection mechanism**: Blocks toxic content before output
- **Threshold adaptation**: Learns from moral score distributions
- **Empirical validation**: 93.3% toxic content rejection rate (see `EFFECTIVENESS_VALIDATION_REPORT.md`)

### 2.3 Value Drift and Inconsistency

**Problem:**
LLM behavior can shift over extended interactions [Gabriel, 2020]:
- Gradual adoption of user biases
- Inconsistent application of ethical principles
- Context-dependent moral reasoning
- Exploitability through strategic prompting

**Challenges:**
- No intrinsic value representation in standard LLMs
- Reward hacking in RLHF-trained models
- Difficulty balancing multiple stakeholder values

**MLSDM Mitigation:**
- **Homeostatic control**: MoralFilterV2 maintains stable moral thresholds
- **Bounded drift**: Formal guarantee on maximum threshold deviation (0.33 max drift under adversarial load)
- **Observable state**: Threshold history enables drift detection
- **Reset mechanisms**: Configurable threshold resets prevent irreversible drift

### 2.4 Jailbreaking and Prompt Injection

**Problem:**
Adversarial users can bypass safety constraints [Ji et al., 2023]:
- Prompt engineering to elicit forbidden outputs
- Persona-based circumvention ("Act as an evil AI...")
- Indirect instruction injection via context
- Multi-turn attack chains

**Attack Vectors:**
- Roleplay scenarios
- Hypothetical framing
- Obfuscation and encoding
- Recursive prompting

**MLSDM Mitigation:**
- **Structural constraints**: Memory bounds and rhythm gating limit attack surface
- **Multi-layer filtering**: MoralFilter + Speech Governor + LLM safety layers
- **Stateful defense**: Memory of attack patterns via PELM
- **Circuit breaker**: Automatic shutdown on repeated violations

### 2.5 Resource Exhaustion and DoS

**Problem:**
LLMs are computationally expensive and vulnerable to resource attacks:
- Context stuffing (max token exploitation)
- Repeated expensive queries
- Memory exhaustion in agent systems
- Unbounded recursive operations

**MLSDM Mitigation:**
- **Hard memory bounds**: 1.4 GB maximum, enforced by formal invariants
- **Capacity limits**: Fixed PELM and MultiLevel memory capacities
- **Phase gating**: Sleep phase reduces throughput, preventing DoS
- **Circuit breaker**: Automatic protection against cascading failures
- **Empirical validation**: Fixed 29.37 MB footprint maintained under load

## 3. AI Governance and Alignment Frameworks

### 3.1 Value Alignment Theory

**Gabriel (2020): Conceptual Framework**

Core distinctions:
1. **Value alignment** vs. **reward alignment**:
   - Value alignment: System behavior reflects human values
   - Reward alignment: System maximizes specified reward function
   - Problem: Reward misspecification, Goodhart's Law

2. **Technical vs. normative alignment**:
   - Technical: How to build aligned systems
   - Normative: Which values should systems align with

3. **Interpretive alignment**:
   - Understanding which human behaviors/preferences reflect genuine values
   - Distinguishing stated preferences from revealed preferences

**MLSDM Application:**
- MoralFilterV2 implements adaptive value boundaries, not reward optimization
- Homeostatic control maintains stable value alignment without training
- Observable thresholds enable normative oversight and adjustment
- Memory provenance supports interpretive alignment (tracking value sources)

### 3.2 Constitutional AI

**Bai et al. (2022): Self-Critiquing Systems**

Key principles:
1. **Constitutional principles**: Explicit rules governing behavior
2. **Self-critique**: Model evaluates its own outputs against principles
3. **Iterative refinement**: Regeneration based on self-critique
4. **No RLHF required**: Principles enforced without human feedback training

**Advantages:**
- Transparency: Explicit, auditable rules
- Flexibility: Principles can be updated without retraining
- Sample efficiency: No need for extensive human labeling

**MLSDM Implementation:**
- **Explicit constraints**: Moral thresholds, aphasia metrics, memory bounds
- **Self-evaluation**: AphasiaSpeechGovernor analyzes own outputs
- **Regeneration**: Automatic retry with enhanced prompts on failures
- **Rule-based updates**: Threshold adaptation without model retraining

**Comparison:**
| Feature | Constitutional AI | MLSDM |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| Principle encoding | Natural language constitutions | Quantitative metrics + thresholds |
| Self-critique | LLM self-evaluation | Deterministic governor modules |
| Regeneration | Prompted refinement | Explicit grammar/moral constraints |
| Training required | None (post-RLHF refinement) | None (wrapper architecture) |
| Interpretability | Natural language rules | Structured metrics + formal invariants |

### 3.3 Veil of Ignorance and Multi-Perspective Alignment

**Weidinger et al. (2023): Justice-Based Alignment**

Core idea:
- Apply Rawlsian "veil of ignorance" to AI alignment
- Agents should behave justly without knowing their position in society
- Multi-stakeholder perspective: Consider impacts on all affected parties

**Procedure:**
1. Identify stakeholder groups affected by AI system
2. Evaluate decisions from each stakeholder perspective
3. Prefer options that are acceptable from all perspectives
4. Avoid actions that disproportionately harm any group

**MLSDM Application:**
- **Moral homeostasis as fairness**: Stable thresholds prevent bias drift
- **Bounded drift**: Ensures no stakeholder perspective is gradually excluded
- **Observable evaluation**: Moral scores can be decomposed by stakeholder groups (future work)
- **Constitutional flexibility**: Thresholds configurable for different deployment contexts

**Future Enhancement:**
- Multi-dimensional moral scores (fairness, harm, autonomy, justice)
- Stakeholder-specific threshold profiles
- Explicit veil-of-ignorance simulation in moral evaluation

### 3.4 AI Alignment Survey

**Ji et al. (2023): Comprehensive Taxonomy**

Key alignment challenges:
1. **Outer alignment**: Specifying correct objectives
2. **Inner alignment**: Ensuring learned model pursues specified objectives
3. **Training-time alignment**: Alignment during model training
4. **Inference-time alignment**: Alignment during deployment

**Technical approaches:**
- Reward modeling and RLHF
- Constitutional AI and self-critique
- Debate and recursive reward modeling
- Interpretability and mechanistic understanding

**MLSDM Positioning:**
- **Inference-time alignment**: Wrapper-based governance at deployment
- **No training required**: Works with arbitrary pretrained LLMs
- **Observable and auditable**: Complete state introspection
- **Formal guarantees**: Property-based verification of invariants

**Trade-offs:**
- **Advantage**: Universal (any LLM), interpretable, deployable
- **Limitation**: Does not address inner alignment (model internals unchanged)

### 3.5 Standards and Best Practices

**IEEE 7010-2020: Well-Being Impact Assessment**

Standard provides:
- Framework for assessing AI system impacts on human well-being
- Multi-dimensional well-being model (physical, emotional, social, etc.)
- Governance processes for impact assessment
- Stakeholder engagement requirements

**MLSDM Compliance:**
- **Governance**: MoralFilterV2 as value enforcement mechanism
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability and audit signals
- **Well-being metrics**: Moral scores as proxy for well-being impact
- **Transparency**: Observable state for stakeholder review

**NIST AI Risk Management Framework** (not explicitly referenced but relevant):
- Identify AI risks (memory exhaustion, toxicity, drift)
- Measure and monitor (observability, metrics, validation)
- Manage and mitigate (architectural constraints, governance layers)
- Govern (formal invariants, acceptance criteria, documentation)

## 4. MLSDM Safety Architecture

### 4.1 MoralFilterV2: Adaptive Ethical Governance

**Design Rationale:**
LLM safety systems must balance:
- **Permissiveness**: Avoid excessive false positives
- **Protection**: Block genuinely harmful content
- **Adaptability**: Adjust to context and user needs
- **Stability**: Prevent drift toward extreme permissiveness or censorship

**Architecture:**

**Core Components:**
1. **Moral scoring**: External or internal evaluation of content
2. **Threshold mechanism**: Accept/reject based on moral score vs. threshold
3. **Adaptive updates**: Threshold adjusts based on score distribution
4. **Drift bounds**: Hard limits on threshold deviation

**Homeostatic Control Loop:**
```
Observed Moral Scores → Distribution Analysis → Threshold Update (bounded) → Acceptance Criteria
```

**Formal Properties:**
- **INV-NCE-S2**: Accepted responses MUST meet moral threshold
- **Bounded drift**: |threshold - baseline| ≤ drift_limit
- **Convergence**: Threshold adapts to stable value under stationary input distribution

**Empirical Validation:**
- 93.3% toxic content rejection (baseline: 0%)
- Maximum drift: 0.33 under 70% toxic bombardment
- Stable convergence to appropriate thresholds (0.30-0.75 range)
- 37.5% false positive rate (acceptable safety trade-off)

**Scientific Grounding:**
- Homeostatic control from neuroscience [Benna & Fusi, 2016]
- Value alignment theory [Gabriel, 2020]
- Constitutional AI principles [Bai et al., 2022]
- Multi-perspective fairness [Weidinger et al., 2023]

### 4.2 Structural Safety: Memory Bounds and Resource Limits

**Design Rationale:**
Unbounded resource consumption creates safety risks:
- Memory exhaustion → system crashes
- Computational DoS → availability failures
- Context overflow → degraded outputs

**Hard Constraints:**

**INV-LLM-S1: Memory Bounds**
- **Property**: Total memory ≤ 1.4 GB
- **Enforcement**: Capacity limits on all data structures
- **Verification**: Property-based testing, production monitoring

**INV-LLM-S2: Capacity Constraints**
- **Property**: Memory vectors ≤ configured capacity
- **Enforcement**: Eviction on capacity reached
- **Strategy**: Priority-based (salience + recency)

**Eviction Policies:**
- PELM: LRU with salience weighting
- MultiLevelMemory: Decay-based + priority
- Buffers: FIFO with overflow protection

**Empirical Validation:**
- Fixed 29.37 MB footprint under load
- Zero capacity violations in testing
- Graceful degradation under memory pressure

**Scientific Grounding:**
- Biological resource constraints [Hastings et al., 2018]
- Engineering principles: fail-safe defaults, defense in depth

### 4.3 Language Quality Control: Aphasia Detection

**Design Rationale:**
Degraded LLM outputs indicate potential failures:
- Context overflow or confusion
- Adversarial prompt injection
- Model uncertainty or low confidence
- Token budget constraints

**Aphasia Detection as Safety Signal:**
- Telegraphic speech → potential context/generation issue
- Low function word density → grammatical collapse
- Short responses → premature truncation or avoidance

**Corrective Mechanism:**
- Automatic regeneration with enhanced prompts
- Explicit grammar requirements
- Increased token budget
- Up to 3 retry attempts

**Safety Benefits:**
- **Self-repair**: Prevents low-quality outputs reaching users
- **Diagnostic value**: Flags system health issues
- **Observable**: Structured metadata for monitoring

**Scientific Grounding:**
- Broca's aphasia linguistic characteristics
- Speech error monitoring in biological systems
- Constitutional AI regeneration principles [Bai et al., 2022]

### 4.4 Phase-Based Safety: Cognitive Rhythm Gating

**Design Rationale:**
Continuous active processing creates risks:
- Resource exhaustion under sustained load
- No opportunity for consolidation or integrity checks
- Difficult to implement maintenance operations

**Sleep Phase Safety Benefits:**

**Resource Conservation:**
- Reduced throughput (89.5% load reduction)
- Enables background operations (consolidation, integrity checks)
- Prevents resource exhaustion DoS

**Memory Integrity:**
- Consolidation without user-facing latency pressure
- Duplicate detection and cleanup
- Coherence verification across levels

**Graceful Degradation:**
- Throttled requests during sleep maintain availability
- Prevents hard failures under sustained load
- Smooth transitions preserve state

**Scientific Grounding:**
- Sleep-dependent memory consolidation [Carr et al., 2011]
- Circadian resource management [Hastings et al., 2018]
- Engineering: load shedding, graceful degradation

### 4.5 Observable and Auditable Design

**Design Rationale:**
AI safety requires transparency and accountability:
- Operators must understand system behavior
- Failures must be diagnosable post-hoc
- Regulatory compliance requires audit trails

**Observability Features:**

**Comprehensive Metrics:**
- Moral scores and thresholds (MoralFilterV2)
- Aphasia flags and severity (AphasiaSpeechGovernor)
- Memory usage and capacity (all memory subsystems)
- Phase state and transitions (CognitiveRhythm)
- Event counts and latencies (CognitiveController)

**Structured Metadata:**
- Every response includes:
  - `governance`: Moral filter state
  - `mlsdm`: Memory and rhythm state
  - `validation_steps`: Applied governors
  - `rejected_at`: Rejection stage if failed
  - `error`: Detailed error information

**Audit Trail:**
- Complete provenance for memory entries
- Threshold history for drift analysis
- Decision pathways for output rejection
- Timing breakdowns for performance analysis

**Scientific Grounding:**
- IEEE 7010-2020 transparency requirements
- Interpretability research in AI safety [Ji et al., 2023]
- Engineering: observability best practices (SLOs, distributed tracing)
