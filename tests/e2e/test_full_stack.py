"""
Full Stack E2E Tests for MLSDM Governance Pipeline.

This module implements production-level full-stack E2E tests that validate
the complete MLSDM pipeline:
    INPUT → GOVERNANCE (moral/rhythm) → MEMORY → LLM → OUTPUT

These tests are designed to be:
- Deterministic: Fixed seeds, stub LLM with predictable responses
- Stable: No flaky behavior, no external dependencies
- Production-like: Uses real ConfigLoader patterns and API contracts

Test Scenarios:
1. Normal Request - Validates full pipeline acceptance and response quality
2. Toxic/Rejected Request - Validates moral filter rejection behavior
3. Aphasic → Repaired - Validates aphasia detection on telegraphic responses
