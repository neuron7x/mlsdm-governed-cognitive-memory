## STRATEGIC (Affecting Scalability and Stability)

### SEC-S001: Partially Mitigated AI Security Risks [PARTIALLY RESOLVED]

**Priority:** HIGH → MEDIUM (2 of 4 items resolved)
**Category:** Security
**Source:** `RISK_REGISTER.md`

**Description:** Originally 5 security risks had "Partially Mitigated" status. Now 2 are resolved:

**Resolved (December 2025):**
- ✅ R003: Multi-turn jailbreak → **Implemented** `analyze_conversation_patterns()` in `llm_safety.py`
- ✅ R018: Indirect prompt injection → **Implemented** `sanitize_context()` in `llm_safety.py`

**Still Open:**
- R012: Policy drift detection (drift alerting system required)
- R015: Hallucination propagation (memory provenance required)

**Implementation Details:**
- `analyze_conversation_patterns()`: Detects gradual manipulation across turns, persistence after refusal, hypothetical framing attacks
- `sanitize_context()`: Removes embedded instructions, hidden unicode, markdown comment injections
- Both functions exported via `mlsdm.security` module
- 15 new tests added covering both functions

**Recommended Actions:**
- [x] Implement attack pattern detection in PELM memory
- [x] Add anomaly detection for conversation patterns
- [ ] Implement memory provenance tracking (R015)
- [x] Add context sanitization layer

---

### ARCH-S001: Lack of Formal API Contract Validation

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Architecture
**Source:** Code analysis

**Description:** FastAPI auto-generates OpenAPI specification, but there is no formal contract validation between API versions.

**Impact:** Potential breaking changes may go unnoticed.

**Recommended Actions:**
- [ ] Integrate OpenAPI diff into CI for detecting breaking changes
- [ ] Implement API versioning (v1, v2) in URLs

---

### ARCH-S002: Experimental Modules Without Clear Lifecycle

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Architecture
**Source:** `src/mlsdm/memory/experimental/`

**Description:** Experimental modules have relaxed type checking and no clear promotion path to stable status.

**Impact:** Technical debt may accumulate.

**Recommended Actions:**
- [ ] Define criteria for "promoting" experimental modules
- [ ] Set deadlines for re-evaluating each module

---

### ARCH-S003: Middleware State Dependency

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Architecture
**Source:** `src/mlsdm/api/middleware.py`

**Description:** Middleware classes inherit from `BaseHTTPMiddleware`, which mypy cannot type (37 errors of type "Class cannot subclass 'BaseHTTPMiddleware'").

**Impact:** Limited type support, harder refactoring.

**Recommended Actions:**
- [ ] Consider migrating to Starlette middleware pure functions
- [ ] Or add type: ignore comments with documented reasons

---

### ARCH-S004: Configuration from Multiple Sources

**Priority:** LOW
**Category:** Architecture
**Source:** Analysis of `config/`, env vars, YAML

**Description:** Configuration can come from:
- Environment variables
- YAML files (`config/default_config.yaml`, `config/production.yaml`)
- Python dataclasses (`config/calibration.py`)
- CLI arguments

This creates potential confusion about priorities.

**Impact:** Complexity in debugging configuration issues.

**Recommended Actions:**
- [ ] Document clear configuration priority hierarchy
- [ ] Add CLI command `mlsdm config --show-effective` to show effective configuration

---

### ~~TEST-S001: Test Coverage Below Target~~ [RESOLVED]

**Priority:** ~~MEDIUM~~ RESOLVED
**Category:** Testing
**Source:** `COVERAGE_REPORT_2025.md`

**Description:** ~~Current coverage is 70.85% with a target of 75% (pyproject.toml).~~

**Resolution:** Coverage now at **78.13%**, exceeding the 75% target. Verified December 2025.

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

### TEST-S002: Partial Chaos Engineering Coverage

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Category:** Testing
**Source:** `tests/chaos/`

**Description:** Chaos engineering tests cover only 3 scenarios (memory pressure, slow LLM, network timeout).

**Impact:** Insufficient confidence in system resilience.

**Recommended Actions:**
- [ ] Add chaos tests for: disk I/O failure, CPU starvation, cascading failures

---

### DEP-S001: Dependency on numpy>=2.0.0

**Priority:** LOW
**Category:** Dependencies
**Source:** `pyproject.toml`

**Description:** numpy 2.0 is a major version with breaking changes. This dependency may limit compatibility with other libraries.

**Impact:** Potential dependency conflicts.

**Recommended Actions:**
- [ ] Evaluate if numpy>=1.26.0,<3.0.0 can be supported

---

### DEP-S002: Optional torch Dependency for NeuroLang

**Priority:** LOW
**Category:** Dependencies
**Source:** `src/mlsdm/extensions/neuro_lang_extension.py`

**Description:** PyTorch is an optional dependency, but its absence may cause runtime errors when trying to use NeuroLang.

**Impact:** Non-obvious errors for users.

**Recommended Actions:**
- [ ] Add clear documentation about torch requirement
- [ ] Improve error message when torch is missing

---

### CICD-S001: No Automatic Rollback

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Category:** CI/CD
**Source:** `.github/workflows/release.yml`

**Description:** Release workflow has no automatic rollback on failed deployment.

**Impact:** Potential downtime on problematic release.

**Recommended Actions:**
- [ ] Add smoke tests after deployment
- [ ] Implement automatic rollback on failed smoke tests

---

### DOC-S001: No Documentation Localization

**Priority:** LOW
**Category:** Documentation
**Source:** Analysis of `docs/`

**Description:** All documentation is in English only.

**Impact:** Limited accessibility for non-English speakers.

**Recommended Actions:**
- [ ] Consider localizing key documents
- [ ] Or keep English-only with clear justification

---

## TECHNICAL DEBT (Planned Refactoring and Improvements)

### ~~TYPE-001: mypy Type Errors (37 errors)~~ [RESOLVED]

**Priority:** ~~LOW~~ RESOLVED
**Category:** Typing
**Source:** `mypy src/mlsdm`

**Actions Completed:**
- [x] types-PyYAML and types-requests included in dev dependencies
- [x] All type stubs properly configured in pyproject.toml
- [x] mypy configuration properly excludes optional/experimental modules

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Verified December 2025

---

### ARCH-D001: Retry Logic Duplication

**Priority:** LOW
**Category:** Architecture
**Source:** `data_serializer.py`, `system_state_store.py`

**Description:** Using `@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3))` in multiple places without centralized configuration.

**Recommended Actions:**

---

### ARCH-D002: Magic Numbers in Code

**Priority:** LOW
**Category:** Architecture
**Source:** Code analysis

**Description:** Some numeric constants (e.g., `temperature=0.7`) are hardcoded without named constants.

---

### ARCH-D003: Temp Files Without Centralized Cleanup

**Priority:** LOW
**Category:** Architecture
**Source:** `system_state_store.py`

**Recommended Actions:**
- [ ] Use `tempfile` module with context managers

---

### ARCH-D004: No Dependency Injection Framework

**Priority:** LOW
**Category:** Architecture
**Source:** Code analysis

**Description:** Dependencies are passed manually through constructors.

**Recommended Actions:**
- [ ] Consider using dependency injection (FastAPI Depends is partially used)

---

### ARCH-D005: Logging Without Structured Fields

**Priority:** LOW
**Category:** Architecture
**Source:** grep "logger.debug"

**Description:** Some debug logs use f-strings instead of structured logging.

---

### CICD-D001: Workflow Step Duplication

**Priority:** LOW
**Category:** CI/CD
**Source:** `.github/workflows/`
