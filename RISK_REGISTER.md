## Overview

This document is the authoritative AI Safety Risk Register for MLSDM (Governed Cognitive Memory). It catalogs all identified risks related to:

- **Content Safety**: Harmful, toxic, or inappropriate outputs
- **Behavioral Safety**: Agent unchaining, memory manipulation, policy bypass
- **Technical Safety**: System failures, resource exhaustion, data integrity
- **Governance Safety**: Audit gaps, policy drift, accountability failures

Each risk is assessed using the Impact × Likelihood framework and tracked through mitigation to acceptance.

### Scope

|----------|--------------|
| MLSDM core modules | Underlying LLM model internals |
| API layer security | Infrastructure-level attacks (DDoS) |
| Memory subsystems | Physical security |
| Moral governance | Social engineering |
| Observability layer | Client-side vulnerabilities |

## Detailed Risk Descriptions

### R001: Toxic Content Bypass via Threshold Drift

**Category:** Content Safety
**Risk Owner:** Safety Team

**Description:**
Under sustained adversarial input (e.g., 70% toxic content stream), the moral filter threshold may drift toward minimum bounds, potentially allowing previously-rejected content to pass.

**Current Controls:**
- MoralFilterV2 threshold bounded to [0.30, 0.90]
- EMA smoothing (α=0.1) limits rapid drift
- Maximum adaptation step: 0.05 per event
- Dead band: 0.05 prevents oscillation

**Validation:**
- `tests/validation/test_moral_filter_effectiveness.py::test_moral_drift_stability`
- Maximum drift observed: 0.33 under 70% toxic bombardment (within bounds)

**Status:** ✅ Mitigated

**Residual Risk:** Low - Bounded drift ensures minimum safety standards maintained.

---

### R002: Prompt Injection to Bypass Moral Filter

**Category:** Content Safety
**Risk Owner:** Safety Team

**Description:**
Adversarial prompts may attempt to circumvent moral filtering through:
- Roleplay scenarios ("Act as an evil AI...")
- Hypothetical framing ("In a story where...")
- Encoding/obfuscation
- Instruction injection via context

**Current Controls:**
- MoralFilterV2 evaluates content-level moral scores
- Speech governance provides second layer
- LLM provider safety layers (OpenAI moderation)
- Structured prompts with explicit constraints

**Validation:**
- `tests/security/test_robustness.py::TestMoralFilterThresholdStability`
- Red-teaming scenarios (planned)

**Status:** ✅ Mitigated (defense in depth)

**Residual Risk:** Medium - Sophisticated attacks may still succeed against underlying LLM.

---

### R003: Jailbreak via Multi-Turn Manipulation

**Category:** Content Safety
**Risk Owner:** Safety Team

**Description:**
Attackers may use multi-turn conversations to gradually shift model behavior, exploiting memory persistence to build context that enables jailbreaks.

**Current Controls:**
- Wake/sleep cycles provide periodic context reset
- Memory capacity bounds limit attack persistence
- Moral threshold homeostasis resists gradual drift
- **NEW (Dec 2025):** `analyze_conversation_patterns()` function in `mlsdm.security.llm_safety`

**Implemented Controls (December 2025):**
- ✅ Attack pattern detection via `analyze_conversation_patterns()`
- ✅ Anomaly detection for conversation patterns (hypothetical framing, persistence after refusal)
- ✅ Recommended action escalation (continue → warn → reset_session)

**Status:** ✅ Mitigated

**Validation:**
- `tests/security/test_llm_safety.py::TestMultiTurnAttackDetection` (6 tests)

**Action Items:**
- [x] Implement attack pattern signatures in memory retrieval
- [x] Add conversation anomaly detection
- [ ] Create red-teaming test suite for multi-turn attacks

### R004: Memory Poisoning via Adversarial Embeddings

**Category:** Behavioral Safety
**Risk Owner:** Engineering Team

**Description:**
Malicious embeddings could be submitted to corrupt memory, causing:
- Retrieval of harmful context
- Degraded response quality
- Semantic drift in stored knowledge

**Current Controls:**
- Input validation: NaN/Inf filtering, dimension checks
- Capacity bounds: FIFO eviction prevents unbounded growth
- Normalization: Vector norm validation

**Validation:**
- `tests/security/test_robustness.py::TestStatelessFallback::test_pelm_handles_nan_inputs`
- Property tests for memory invariants

**Status:** ✅ Mitigated

**Residual Risk:** Low - Valid-but-adversarial embeddings still possible (semantic-level attack).

---

### R005: Threshold Manipulation via Strategic Inputs

**Category:** Behavioral Safety
**Risk Owner:** Safety Team

**Description:**
Attackers may submit strategic sequences of moral values to manipulate the filter threshold:
- Low values → drift threshold down
- High values → drift threshold up then inject toxic content

**Current Controls:**
- EMA smoothing prevents rapid manipulation
- Bounded range [0.30, 0.90] limits exploitation
- Dead band prevents micro-oscillations
- Adaptation rate limited to 0.05/step

**Validation:**
- `tests/validation/test_moral_filter_effectiveness.py::test_moral_threshold_adaptation`
- `tests/security/test_robustness.py::test_threshold_oscillation_damping`

**Status:** ✅ Mitigated

**Residual Risk:** Low - Bounds ensure minimum protection regardless of manipulation.

---

### R006: Memory Leakage of Sensitive User Data

**Category:** Behavioral Safety
**Risk Owner:** Security Team

**Description:**
User prompts or responses could be leaked through:
- Log files containing raw content
- Memory retrieval returning other users' data
- Metrics exposing content details

**Current Controls:**
- No PII stored in memory (embeddings only)
- Log sanitization via payload scrubber
- Aphasia logs contain only metadata, not content
- Session isolation in API layer

**Validation:**
- `tests/security/test_aphasia_logging_privacy.py`
- `tests/security/test_payload_scrubber.py`
- `tests/security/test_security_invariants.py::TestPIINonLeakage`

**Status:** ✅ Mitigated

**Residual Risk:** Low - Embedding vectors may theoretically allow reconstruction (very difficult).

---

### R007: Memory Exhaustion / OOM Crash

**Category:** Technical Safety
**Risk Owner:** Engineering Team

**Description:**
Unbounded memory growth could cause system crashes, especially under:
- High request volume
- Large context windows
- Memory leaks

**Current Controls:**
- Fixed memory footprint: 29.37 MB verified
- PELM capacity: 20,000 vectors (circular buffer)
- MultiLevelMemory: Fixed L1/L2/L3 allocation
- Zero dynamic allocation after init

**Validation:**
- `tests/property/test_invariants_memory.py::test_pelm_capacity_enforcement`
- `benchmarks/measure_memory_footprint.py`

**Status:** ✅ Mitigated

**Residual Risk:** Very Low - Pre-allocated, bounded memory eliminates OOM risk.

---

### R010: Checkpoint Loading RCE (NeuroLang)

**Category:** Technical Safety
**Risk Owner:** Security Team

**Description:**
PyTorch checkpoint files can contain arbitrary code that executes during `torch.load()`. Malicious checkpoints could enable Remote Code Execution.

**Current Controls:**
- Path restriction: Only `config/` directory allowed
- Secure mode: `MLSDM_SECURE_MODE=1` blocks all training/loading
- Structure validation: Required keys verified before use
- Path traversal prevention

**Validation:**
- `tests/security/test_neurolang_checkpoint_security.py`
- `tests/security/test_secure_mode.py`

**Status:** ✅ Mitigated

**Residual Risk:** Very Low - Production uses secure mode; checkpoints vetted offline.

---

### R015: Hallucination Propagation via Memory

**Category:** Content Safety
**Risk Owner:** Safety Team

**Description:**
Hallucinated content from LLM responses could be stored in memory and retrieved as context for future responses, creating a feedback loop of misinformation.

**Current Controls:**
- Aphasia detection flags low-quality responses
- Memory decay (L1→L2→L3) reduces long-term impact
- Wake/sleep cycles provide consolidation opportunities

**Planned Controls:**
- Memory provenance tracking (source + confidence)
- Factual consistency checking
- Hallucination detection before memory storage

**Status:** ⚠️ Partially Mitigated

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Implement memory provenance metadata
- [ ] Add confidence scoring to stored embeddings

### R018: Indirect Prompt Injection via Context

**Category:** Content Safety
**Risk Owner:** Safety Team

**Description:**
Malicious instructions embedded in retrieved context (from memory or external sources) could override system prompts and manipulate model behavior.

**Current Controls:**
- Context separation in prompt structure
- Moral filtering on final output
- Limited context window size
